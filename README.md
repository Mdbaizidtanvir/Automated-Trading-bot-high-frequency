üìà  AI Trading Bot (OpenAI + MetaTrader 5 + binary )

This project is an automated trading bot that connects MetaTrader 5 (MT5) with OpenAI.
It fetches the last 10 candlesticks from MT5, uses OpenAI to predict the next move (buy/sell/hold), and then places a market order automatically with stop-loss and take-profit.

üöÄ Features

Connects securely to MetaTrader 5 using account credentials.

Fetches the last 10 √ó 15-minute candles for analysis.

Uses OpenAI GPT models (e.g., gpt-4o-mini) to predict the next market move.

AI returns a structured JSON response:

{
  "signal": "buy",
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "price_target_usd": 1.0952,
  "take_profit_pips": 20,
  "stop_loss_pips": 100,
  "reason": "EURUSD is showing bullish momentum after support bounce."
}


Automatically places Buy/Sell orders in MT5 with defined TP & SL.

Exits safely if the signal is "hold".
